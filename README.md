# StatHub

**Author: Chris Ehster**

## Goals

1. Fetch csv data from OOTP saves.
2. Build a dashboard to display statistics.
    - Most stats will be generated by OOTP and can be accessed ingame. 
    - Calculate league averages and allow player comparisons to league average. 
    - Display a player's performance/rating compared to other players around the league with similar *salaries*. 
3. Use the acquired statistics to provide a summary for a player's development. 
    - Factor age, scout ratings, other player's stats (with similar ratings), expected outcome vs actual outcome (does your high discipline batter actually get on-base at a good rate? does your `67` homerun rating batter log less homeruns than your average RF?)
4. ***Allow publicly sharing statistics.***
    - The main goal of this app.
    - The reason why we repeat showing stats that you can view in-game, it allows others to keep up with someone's save.
